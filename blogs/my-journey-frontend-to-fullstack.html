    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      When I started my BTech journey, I believed that scoring well in academics
      would be enough. But very early in my first year, I realized that the tech
      industry values <strong>skills, curiosity, and hands-on experience</strong>
      just as much as grades.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      In the tech world, skills matter as much as — if not more than — academics.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>First Year: Confusion Before Clarity</h2>
    <p>
      During my first year, I knew I needed skills beyond classroom learning,
      but I had no clear direction. I explored countless YouTube videos and
      learning roadmaps, only to discover how vast and overwhelming the tech
      ecosystem really is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of chasing everything, I made a simple but important decision:
      <strong>start from the basics</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Building Foundations: HTML, CSS, and Tailwind</h2>
    <p>
      I began with HTML and CSS to understand how the web works at a fundamental
      level. Later, I learned Tailwind CSS, which helped me think in terms of
      reusable components and clean UI systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      This phase taught me patience, attention to detail, and the importance of
      strong foundations.
    </p>

    <h2>Second Year: JavaScript and Core Programming</h2>
    <p>
      In my second year, I stepped into JavaScript, which completely changed my
      understanding of frontend development. I learned how logic drives user
      interactions and how applications respond dynamically.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, my college curriculum emphasized C++, helping me develop
      core programming skills, problem-solving ability, and logical thinking.
    </p>

    <h2>Third Year: Exploration and Expansion</h2>
    <p>
      My third year marked a phase of exploration. I dove into Python, Machine
      Learning, Cloud concepts, and Edge Computing. During this phase, React
      stood out as the most practical framework for building modern web
      applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      I built multiple projects using React and related technologies, which
      boosted my confidence and shifted my focus from learning to building.
    </p>

    <h2>Turning Point: Internship at a Startup</h2>
    <p>
      The projects and skills I developed helped me secure an internship at a
      startup. This experience transformed how I viewed software development.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, I worked on real production systems, collaborated with
      teams, and understood how technical decisions impact business outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>Backend, Databases, and Deployment Reality</h2>
    <p>
      During my internship, my curiosity pushed me beyond frontend development.
      I worked on backend APIs, database queries, views, and analytics pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most impactful experiences was learning <strong>NGINX</strong>
      during deployment. I handled reverse proxy configurations, routing, and
      static file serving—understanding that software is incomplete until it
      runs reliably in production.
    </p>

    <h2>Where I Stand Today</h2>
    <p>
      Today, I see myself as someone who understands frontend systems, backend
      logic, databases, and deployment fundamentals. This journey has shaped my
      mindset as an engineer rather than just a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am now actively seeking opportunities in <strong>big MNCs</strong>,
      where I can apply this full-stack thinking, continue learning, and grow
      professionally.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Confusion is a natural part of learning</li>
      <li>Strong fundamentals outlast trends</li>
      <li>Projects accelerate understanding</li>
      <li>Startups teach ownership and responsibility</li>
      <li>Deployment knowledge completes the engineering cycle</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      My journey from frontend curiosity to full-stack thinking has been gradual,
      sometimes confusing, but deeply rewarding. I still have a long way to go,
      but I now know how to learn, what to focus on, and why consistency matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not the end of my journey—it’s the foundation for everything that
      comes next.
